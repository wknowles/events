# Projects

A list of things to make / do / learn on - for personal reference and development.

- [ ] Make something similar to [Septa System Map](http://www3.septa.org/hackathon/SystemMap/), perhaps with d3.js and have it update in realtime.
- [ ] Sort out portfolio site / blog. Pop it up on Github pages. [wknowles.github.io](http://wknowles.github.io)
- [ ] Finish [Intaglio GL](http://wknowles.github.io/projects/intaglio-gl/)- part of larger goal, make awsome things at mapbox!

2016-09-14 | [DVRPC](http://www.dvrpc.org/) - [IREG 100th Meeting with GeoPhilly](http://www.meetup.com/GeoPhilly/events/233261635/) | A fun day of talks about transport/infrastructure/gis. Some of it was a little enterprisey but other talks were fascinating. My highlights were amtrack, code for philly, and parkadelphia. Plus good cupcakes!
2016-08-03 | [BucksCo Js - Lightning Talks](http://www.meetup.com/Bucks-Co-Js/events/231227258/) | This mostly went over my head, I was rather tired. The topics seemed pretty advanced, above my level but I enjoyed the pacing and picked up some neat stuff. I can imagine the localization and internationalization will come in handy in the future.
2016-03-01 | [Geovation Hub](https://geovation.uk/) - GeoTech Masterclass | Mapbox fun! I built a map tracking hurricanes in the Atlantic. I had to delete the map as I had run out of space on mapbox. I still have the data so there might be a reprise! I really enjoyed this one and it was great meeting people who work at the ordinance survey (I'm a big fan.)
