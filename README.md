# Projects

A list of things to make / do / learn on - for personal reference and development.

- [ ] Make something similar to [Septa System Map](http://www3.septa.org/hackathon/SystemMap/), perhaps with d3.js and have it update in realtime.
- [ ] Sort out portfolio site / blog. Pop it up on Github pages. [wknowles.github.io](http://wknowles.github.io)
- [ ] Finish [Intaglio GL](http://wknowles.github.io/projects/intaglio-gl/)- part of larger goal, make awsome things at mapbox!
