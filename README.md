# Projects

A list of things to make / do / learn on - for personal reference and development.

- [ ] Finish goofing around with Phila's [L&I](https://github.com/wknowles/phila-lni-data) Data. So far have some d3 and philly ipsum. Would like to look at how this can be compared to data like that showing prevalence of lead in buildings and examine likely locations for unfit rental housing.
- [ ] Make something similar to [Septa System Map](http://www3.septa.org/hackathon/SystemMap/), perhaps with d3.js and have it update in realtime.
- [ ] Sort out portfolio site / blog. Pop it up on Github pages. [wknowles.github.io](http://wknowles.github.io)
- [ ] Finish [Intaglio GL](http://wknowles.github.io/projects/intaglio-gl/)- part of larger goal, make awsome things at mapbox!

2016-10-10 | [Geodesign Forum @ PhilaU](http://www.philau.edu/geodesignforum/) | An afternoon of talks on the use of Geodesign in planning healthier communities. I had not come across geodesign before. An interesting interdisciplinary approach. I wasn't totally convinced on the merits of this as opposed to traditional planning or gis.
2016-10-06 | [2016 Geo Open Source Meetup presented by LocationTech & GeoPhilly](https://www.meetup.com/GeoPhilly/events/233258131/) | Great evening learning about open source contributions to geospatial stuff. Highlights were Carto and Cesium - tracking Santa with Norad. Had to leave early for train, sad to miss Mapzen.
2016-10-05 | [Building Set-top-box Apps using AngularJS](https://www.meetup.com/Bucks-Co-Js/events/233911859/) @ BucksCoJS | A talk mostly about building set-top-box apps, not really about angular. Focus more on ux considerations and platform specifics - xbox / playstation requirements ect...
2016-09-24 | [City as a Service (Hackathon)](https://codeforphilly.org/blog/city_as_a_service_hackathon_2016) | My first hackathon, a long day looking at L&I data. I have been working further with the data and have put a bit up on [github](https://github.com/wknowles/phila-lni-data). Its a real work in progress.
2016-09-14 | [DVRPC](http://www.dvrpc.org/) - [IREG 100th Meeting with GeoPhilly](http://www.meetup.com/GeoPhilly/events/233261635/) | A fun day of talks about transport/infrastructure/gis. Some of it was a little enterprisey but other talks were fascinating. My highlights were amtrack, code for philly, and parkadelphia. Plus good cupcakes!
2016-08-03 | [BucksCo Js - Lightning Talks](http://www.meetup.com/Bucks-Co-Js/events/231227258/) | This mostly went over my head, I was rather tired. The topics seemed pretty advanced, above my level but I enjoyed the pacing and picked up some neat stuff. I can imagine the localization and internationalization will come in handy in the future.
2016-03-01 | [Geovation Hub](https://geovation.uk/) - GeoTech Masterclass | Mapbox fun! I built a map tracking hurricanes in the Atlantic. I had to delete the map as I had run out of space on mapbox. I still have the data so there might be a reprise! I really enjoyed this one and it was great meeting people who work at the ordinance survey (I'm a big fan.)
