2016-10-10 | [Geodesign Forum @ PhilaU](http://www.philau.edu/geodesignforum/) | An afternoon of talks on the use of Geodesign in planning healthier communities. I had not come across geodesign before. An interesting interdisciplinary approach. I wasn't totally convinced on the merits of this as opposed to traditional planning or gis.
2016-10-06 | [2016 Geo Open Source Meetup presented by LocationTech & GeoPhilly](https://www.meetup.com/GeoPhilly/events/233258131/) | Great evening learning about open source contributions to geospatial stuff. Highlights were Carto and Cesium - tracking Santa with Norad. Had to leave early for train, sad to miss Mapzen.
2016-10-05 | [Building Set-top-box Apps using AngularJS](https://www.meetup.com/Bucks-Co-Js/events/233911859/) @ BucksCoJS | A talk mostly about building set-top-box apps, not really about angular. Focus more on ux considerations and platform specifics - xbox / playstation requirements ect...
2016-09-24 | [City as a Service (Hackathon)](https://codeforphilly.org/blog/city_as_a_service_hackathon_2016) | My first hackathon, a long day looking at L&I data. I have been working further with the data and have put a bit up on [github](https://github.com/wknowles/phila-lni-data). Its a real work in progress.
2016-09-14 | [DVRPC](http://www.dvrpc.org/) - [IREG 100th Meeting with GeoPhilly](http://www.meetup.com/GeoPhilly/events/233261635/) | A fun day of talks about transport/infrastructure/gis. Some of it was a little enterprisey but other talks were fascinating. My highlights were amtrack, code for philly, and parkadelphia. Plus good cupcakes!
2016-08-03 | [BucksCo Js - Lightning Talks](http://www.meetup.com/Bucks-Co-Js/events/231227258/) | This mostly went over my head, I was rather tired. The topics seemed pretty advanced, above my level but I enjoyed the pacing and picked up some neat stuff. I can imagine the localization and internationalization will come in handy in the future.
2016-03-01 | [Geovation Hub](https://geovation.uk/) - GeoTech Masterclass | Mapbox fun! I built a map tracking hurricanes in the Atlantic. I had to delete the map as I had run out of space on mapbox. I still have the data so there might be a reprise! I really enjoyed this one and it was great meeting people who work at the ordinance survey (I'm a big fan.)
