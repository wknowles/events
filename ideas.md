**Ideas List.  Things to build and learn with - for personal development and general itch scratching.**

- [ ] Finish goofing around with Phila's [L&I](https://github.com/wknowles/phila-lni-data) Data. So far have some d3 and philly ipsum. Would like to look at how this can be compared to data like that showing prevalence of lead in buildings and examine likely locations for unfit rental housing.
- [ ] Make something similar to [Septa System Map](http://www3.septa.org/hackathon/SystemMap/), perhaps with d3.js and have it update in realtime.
- [ ] Sort out portfolio site / blog. Pop it up on Github pages. [wknowles.github.io](http://wknowles.github.io)
- [ ] Finish [Intaglio GL](http://wknowles.github.io/projects/intaglio-gl/)- part of larger goal, make awsome things at mapbox!
