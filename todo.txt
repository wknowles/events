# To Do

- [ ] Sort out portfolio site / blog. Pop it up on Github pages. [wknowles.github.io](http://wknowles.github.io)
- [ ] Finish goofing around with Phila's [L&I](https://github.com/wknowles/phila-lni-data) Data. So far have some d3 and philly ipsum. Would like to look at how this can be compared to data like that showing prevalence of lead in buildings and examine likely locations for unfit rental housing.
	- [ ] Jupyter notebook exploration of data.
- [ ] Work on [Intaglio GL](http://wknowles.github.io/projects/intaglio-gl/)
	- [ ] get bathymetry to sit below land styles.
